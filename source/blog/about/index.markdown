<h2 id='aboutblog' >About this blog</h2>
<p>  This blog was created to save thoughts about programming and some tips&tricks I found while working.
 Hence, it is about things I'm doing at work - C++, HPC, Computer Vision, LAMMPS, teaching Java.
</p>

<h2 id='bio' >My bio</h2>
<p>  
I'm an enthusiastic programmer and a researcher. I enjoy solving challenging problems as well as learning new fields and technologies. I started writing programs when I was fifteen and still like it. Since I was 20 years old I'm Software Engineer, I took part into developing software for CAD and GIS industries (check CV for details). At the same time I graduated from Mathematical department of Novosibirsk State University. Being both mathematician and programmer I'm interested in fields where these two words are intersecting - high performance computations, fluid dynamics, computer vision, shape analysis, and physical based computer graphics. Check out my blog posts and github and let me know if you have some ideas of collaboration regarding things I'm interested in.<br><br>
