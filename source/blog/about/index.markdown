<h2 id='aboutblog' >About this blog</h2>
<p>  This blog was created to save thoughts about programming and some tips&tricks I found while working.
 Hence, it is about things I'm doing at work - C++, HPC, LAMMPS, teaching Java.
</p>

<h2 id='bio' >My bio</h2>
<p>  I'm enthusiastic programmer and enjoy solving challenging problems. All my adult life I'm
developing software and, in free time, play guitar in heavy metal bands. I started programming 
when I was fifteen. When I was seventeen I had developed toy applications in C, Java and VB - for instance,
I wrote Pascal translator using JavaCC. Then I was studying Mathematics for 5 years. 
There was almost no programming so I learned by myself C++ and wrote computational applications,
this time I also played with gpgpu and Cg. When I was 20 years old I went to my first job. 
Further history is written in the CV. In parallel to studying and writing code, I played metal in several bands.
In 2010, I pick up a new hobby - teach students. First, I taught them algorithms, later we 
(I and the friend of mine E. Mikerin) created course "Design Patterns". The idea was to create a course 
where students could meet engineers from industry, instead of scientists. Most lectures were made by Mikerin and me, 
but we also invited other engineers. Some of them employed students after the course. I shall mention that 
we taught for free, just because we liked inspiring talented people to be software engineers. 
This time I also organized other activities - English club for training oral English, lectures for programmers by programmers (there were 2 about V8 and Google Native Client). In 2011, I suddenly left Russia and industry for a PhD student position at University of Italian Switzerland. Since this time Iâ€™m doing research in biophysics. From engineering point of view, I write HPC applications using C++ and MPI. There is a lot physics and a bit of computational geometry. The code is running on clusters and uses 128-1024 cores.
